# GenAI-Assignment: 

This assingment compares 2 of ways to estimate the best-fit slope (m) for a linear dataset using two optimization strategies:
Brute-force search: takes multiple slope values within range, compares and selectes MSE with lowest value.
Gradient Descent : Iteratively redefines the slope value using optimization techniques.

# Features:

Dataset Generation: Creates a dataset with random noise.
Optimal Slopw: Brute-force and gradient descent in finding the optimal slope.
Visualization: Dataset plot and loss curves visualization.
Performance comparison: Evaluation of both methods w.r.t. efficiency and accuracy

# Example Output:

Best slope using brute-force: 2.97980  
Best slope using gradient descent: 2.99216  
Gradient descent is met faster than brute-force. 

# Dependencies and Installations:
Requirements are: 
numpy
matplotlib

Installation:
Make sure to have Python installed and install the necessary libraries:

pip install numpy matplotlib
